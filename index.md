I'm starting a PostDoc in theoretical neuroscience at McGill/Mila with [Blake Richards][blake]. 
 
Currently, I work on biologically plausible learning in deep networks ([NeurIPS 2020][plausible-kernelized-bottleneck] work on 3-factor Hebbian learning rules for deep nets; [NeurIPS 2021][plausible-conv] on plausibility of convolutional networks). I also work on representation learning using kernel methods. Here are my works on self-supervised learning ([NeurIPS 2021][ssl-hsic]) and conditionally invariant representations ([arXiv pre-print][circe], accepted to ICLR 2023 as notable-top-5%).

I did my PhD in theoretical neuroscience with [Peter E. Latham][pel] at [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit][gatsby] (UCL, London).
During my PhD, I did a breadth rotation project in multi-armed bandits with [Tor Lattimore][tor] (DeepMind). 
Before joining Gatsby in 2017, I received a BSc (honours) in applied mathematics and physics
from [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology][mipt] (2013-2017). I also finished the first year of the 
[Yandex School of Data Analysis][shad] (2016-2017, CS department).

Besides that, I did a few research internships:

1. [Skoltech, Moscow][skoltech], Yury Maximov's research group (2016-2017);
2. [EPFL, SRP program][epfl], Wulfram Gerstner's lab (summer 2016);
3. [LMU, Amgen Scholars program][lmu], Christian Leibold's lab (summer 2015).
