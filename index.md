I am a PhD student in theoretical neuroscience at [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit][gatsby] (UCL, London). 

Before joining Gatsby in 2017, I received a BSc (honours) in applied mathematics and physics
from [Moscow Insitute of Physics and Technology][mipt] (2013-2017). I also finished the first year of the 
[Yandex School of Data Analysis][shad] (2016-2017, CS department).

Besides that, I did a few research internships:

1. [Skoltech, Moscow][skoltech], Yury Maximov's research group (2016-2017);
2. [EPFL, SRP program][epfl], Wulfram Gerstner's lab (summer 2016);
3. [LMU, Amgen Scholars program][lmu], Christian Leibold's lab (summer 2015).
